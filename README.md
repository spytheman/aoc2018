# December 2018: Advent of Code Solutions
Delyan Angelov

I am doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.
This repo contains my solutions of the challenges, as I solve them.

Contents:
=======================================

./cookie - You should create it yourself. It contains a single line like this:  session=74506ff802....
         You can get it logging into the https://adventofcode.com website, then seeing your cookies.

./prepare_for_day - A helper script, that prepares a new folder for a given day.

                  Usage: ./prepare_for_day 2
                  
                  It will make a draft in folder day2/ and download the input for this day for you.
                  
                  All that remains for you to do then, is the fun part - solving the problem.

./common.php - This file contains utility functions used by all solutions.

./day*/ - The folders contain the solutions for a given AOC problem.
